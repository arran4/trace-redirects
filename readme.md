# Trace redirects

A simple CLI application to trace the redirects on a website.

It's really very simple happy to accept PRs.

Usage:
```shell
./trace-redirects https://website1.com
```

Output:
```text
Tracing https://website1.com
1: https://website1.com
2: https://website1.com/index.html
```

I will extend on an as need basis. Happy for PRs / redirect-to-active-forks etc
